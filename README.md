## Project Description:

Conventional land registry systems can be unreliable when it comes to checking the ownership of the property, which opens up an opportunity for malicious behaviour by people selling property that does not belong to them. Property-related fraud might not be as common as other kinds of fraud, but it is definetely one of the most painful and costly for the property owners who have to go through a legal process to revert the already happened transfer of ownership.  

Our mission is to protect owners from property fraud by **storing proof of ownership on the blockchain** and tracking changes in the official off-chain land registry. We expect an introduction of Central Bank Digital Coin (CBDC) in the near future and the following migration of land registry onto the blockchain. Anticipating those changes we aim to become **the first official land registry and a platform which will enable quick and secure property ownership transfers.**


## Our services:
* Notification in case a change in the off-chain land registry is detected. The owner will be asked to confirm the transfer of ownership. 
* Property market where onwers of properties listed on the platform are verified through the public ledger. The platform will connect property buyers and sellers and ensure secure deals.
* In addition, verified owners can have a NFT on a property issued to them, which cam be used as a collateral for loans in CBDC

Notification service is subscription-based with regular monthly payments. A commission of 0.5% is charged for the deals through the platform.
